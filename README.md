### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I recently graduated from the University of California Irvine with a degree in Computer Science. I've learned about various programming languages since UCI, and the programming languages I like the most are Python and Java. I have experience in web development using restful APIs and third-party APIs, so I am also pretty familiar with frontend frameworks: Angular and React, as well as HTML, CSS, JavaScipt, and TypeScript.
