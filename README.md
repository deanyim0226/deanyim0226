### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Dean, a 4th year computer science student at University of California Irvine.

I'm currently looking for a summer internship in 2022. The programming languages that I have worked with are C, C++, Java, and Python. I'm currently learning machine learning, information retrieval, and principles of operating systems at school. Besides school work, I'm learning web development such as javascript and react.
